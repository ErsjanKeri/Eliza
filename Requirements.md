# AI Tutor App - Requirements Specification

## Project Overview
**Timeline**: 21 days  
**Target**: Functional MVP demo  
**AI Model**: Gemma-3n-E4B-it-int4 (4.4GB, text + vision)  
**Architecture**: nowinandroid modular + gallery-edge-ai integration

## User Stories with EARS Notation

### Epic 1: Core AI Tutoring Experience

#### Story 1.1: Model Setup and Initialization
**As a** student user  
**I want** the AI model to be automatically downloaded and ready to use  
**So that** I can start getting tutoring help immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the app is launched for the first time THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically download the Gemma-3n model with progress indicator
- WHEN the model download is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL initialize the model and show "Ready" status
- WHEN the model initialization fails THE SYSTEM SHALL display error message and retry option
- WHEN the model is ready THE SYSTEM SHALL enable the chat interface within 10 seconds

#### Story 1.2: Basic AI Chat Interface
**As a** student  
**I want** to ask the AI tutor questions about math problems  
**So that** I can get help with my homework

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user types a math question THE SYSTEM SHALL respond with relevant explanation within 3 seconds
- WHEN a user asks for step-by-step solutions THE SYSTEM SHALL provide numbered steps with explanations
- WHEN a user submits an empty message THE SYSTEM SHALL prompt for a valid question
- WHEN the AI cannot answer a question THE SYSTEM SHALL suggest alternative ways to ask

#### Story 1.3: Image-Based Problem Solving
**As a** student  
**I want** to take photos of math problems and get explanations  
**So that** I can understand problems from textbooks or assignments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user uploads an image with math content THE SYSTEM SHALL analyze the image using Gemma-3n vision capabilities
- WHEN the image contains a math problem THE SYSTEM SHALL provide step-by-step solution
- WHEN the image is unclear or contains no math THE SYSTEM SHALL ask for a clearer image
- WHEN processing an image THE SYSTEM SHALL show loading indicator

#### Story 1.4: Simple Course Content System
**As a** student  
**I want** to access structured math lessons  
**So that** I can learn topics systematically

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user opens the courses section THE SYSTEM SHALL display available math topics (Algebra, Geometry, etc.)
- WHEN a user selects a topic THE SYSTEM SHALL show lesson content with examples
- WHEN a user completes reading a lesson THE SYSTEM SHALL mark it as complete
- WHEN a user asks questions about lesson content THE SYSTEM SHALL provide contextual answers

#### Story 1.5: Basic Progress Tracking
**As a** student  
**I want** to see my learning progress  
**So that** I can track my improvement

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user completes activities THE SYSTEM SHALL save progress locally
- WHEN a user opens the progress screen THE SYSTEM SHALL show topics covered and time spent
- WHEN a user has no progress data THE SYSTEM SHALL display welcome message with getting started tips
- WHEN the app is reopened THE SYSTEM SHALL restore previous progress and conversation history

### Epic 2: Performance and Reliability

#### Story 2.1: Efficient Model Management
**As a** user  
**I want** the app to run smoothly without consuming excessive resources  
**So that** I can use it on my device without issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the model is loaded THE SYSTEM SHALL use no more than 6GB of RAM
- WHEN generating responses THE SYSTEM SHALL complete inference within 3 seconds
- WHEN the device is low on memory THE SYSTEM SHALL gracefully handle memory pressure
- WHEN the app is backgrounded THE SYSTEM SHALL efficiently manage model resources

#### Story 2.2: Offline Functionality
**As a** user  
**I want** full functionality without internet connection  
**So that** I can learn anywhere

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the device has no internet THE SYSTEM SHALL continue to provide AI tutoring
- WHEN offline THE SYSTEM SHALL save all progress and conversations locally
- WHEN internet is restored THE SYSTEM SHALL not require re-downloading the model
- WHEN switching between online/offline THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain seamless experience
