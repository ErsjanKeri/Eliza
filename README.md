## 🌟 Why ELIZA?

Millions worldwide face significant hurdles in accessing quality education. Studies show:
* **172 million students** encounter systemic barriers.
* **65%** feel disengaged in traditional classrooms.
* **Over 70%** experience anxiety about asking questions in class.

ELIZA is built to solve these critical problems. We believe education should be for everyone, and our platform is designed to unlock a world of knowledge – offline, in your own language, and at your own pace.

## ⚙️ How ELIZA Works (Technical Highlights)

ELIZA's core intelligence is powered by **Gemma 3n**, Google's powerful and efficient AI model, enabling high-quality content generation and intelligent responses. Our robust, layered architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and seamless operation:

* **User Interaction Layer:** Handles the adaptable and intuitive user interface, capturing diverse inputs and presenting responses.
* **Application Logic Layer:** Manages the entire chat flow and personalized learning experiences, leveraging our advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for highly context-aware interactions. This ensures responses are grounded in accurate information.
* **Data and AI Services Layer:** Contains the `Eliza Database` (our comprehensive digital library), responsible for content indexing, embedding generation, and rapid vector search capabilities to feed relevant information to Gemma 3n.

This robust design ensures ELIZA can provide grounded, accurate, and dynamic educational content, truly elevating human potential.

## 🛣️ Future Enhancements and Considerations

We are continuously working to enhance ELIZA. Our future roadmap includes:
* **Improving App Performance and Scope:** Due to current limitations in our data and capacity, we are using external APIs for translation and text-to-code generation. Our long-term vision is to perform functions like translation and Manim code generation directly within the app, leveraging a larger, finely tuned dataset. This will significantly boost performance and create a more robust, self-contained user experience.
* **Boosting User Engagement:** To make learning more interactive and enjoyable, we plan to implement **gamification** (points, badges) and enable **social interaction** for collaboration among students.
* **A Data-Driven Approach to Learning:** We aim to create a comprehensive data feedback loop. This will provide valuable insights for **teachers** (student performance, struggling areas), **institutions** (academic trends, curriculum improvement), and **parents** (transparent view of progress, targeted support).
