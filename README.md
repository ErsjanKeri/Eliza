# ELIZA: Universal Learning Platform

## Empowering Education for Everyone, Everywhere

ELIZA is an innovative universal learning platform designed to break down educational barriers, making knowledge accessible to anyone, regardless of their location, financial situation, or language. Powered by Gemma 3n, ELIZA provides a personalized and interactive learning experience both online and offline.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Universal Digital Library:** Converts comprehensive educational materials into a proprietary "Eliza database" for efficient access.

* **Offline Accessibility:** Generates instant exercises and explanations in text format even without an internet connection, leveraging Gemma 3n.

* **Multilingual Interaction:** Supports user interaction in their preferred language, with seamless translation capabilities for both input and output.

* **Personalized Learning Pace:** Allows users to learn at their own speed, adapting to individual needs.

* **Interactive Explanations:** When online, leverages Gemma 3n to generate Manim code for engaging whiteboard-style video explanations, voiced in the user's original language via Google's translation API.

* **High-Quality Content:** Utilizes Gemma's powerful capabilities for problem generation, solving, explanation, and code generation to ensure consistent, high-quality learning experiences.

* **Efficient Backend:** Designed for exceptional backend efficiency, ensuring smooth and responsive performance.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

ELIZA operates in two primary modes:

1.  **Offline Mode:**

    * The platform accesses its pre-built "Eliza database" of universal books.

    * User prompts are processed locally.

    * Gemma 3n generates relevant exercises and explanations, delivering them as text directly to the user.

2.  **Online Mode:**

    * User prompts are translated into English using Google Translate.

    * The translated prompt is sent to Gemma 3n for question generation or explanation content.

    * **For Questions:** Gemma generates questions, which are then translated back into the user's original language and presented as text.

    * **For Explanations:** Gemma generates Manim code, which ELIZA uses to create dynamic whiteboard-style animations. These animations are then voiced in the user's original language using Google's translation API.

*Named ELIZA as a playful homage to the very first AI chatbot from the 20th century, reminding us that AI isn't some futuristic fantasy; it's been evolving for decades! Today, this evolution allows us to build an AI that genuinely elevates human potential, rather than just mimicking it.*
