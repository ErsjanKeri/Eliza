**Task**: Complete architectural redesign of exercise help system  
**Owner**: Full Team (Frontend + Backend + Chat Specialist)  
**Estimated**: 12 hours (High Priority)  
**Status**: ON HOLD - Will be superseded by new 3-phase approach above
**Dependencies**: Gallery chat analysis required  

#### **What Needs to be Done - Step by Step:**

**STEP 1: Remove Current Split-Screen Logic (2 hours)**
- [X] **DELETE** the current `ExerciseHelpInterface` component completely
- [X] **REMOVE** split-screen layout from exercise help UI
- [X] **DELETE** old exercise help navigation components
- [X] **CLEAN UP** any references to split-screen exercise help
- [X] **REMOVE** old "Generate New Trial" | "Ask for Explanation" side-by-side layout
- [X] **VERIFY** that test results screen no longer uses old help interface

**STEP 2: Study and Copy Gallery Chat Interface (3 hours)**
- [X] **ANALYZE** gallery chat UI components extensively
- [X] **IDENTIFY** exact chat interface components from gallery project
- [X] **COPY** gallery chat composables 100% exactly (layout, styling, behavior)
- [X] **UNDERSTAND** gallery chat message types, especially video messages
- [X] **DOCUMENT** gallery chat navigation patterns
- [X] **MAP** gallery chat state management to our exercise context

**STEP 3: Create Exercise-Specific Chat System (4 hours)**
- [X] **CREATE** new chat session type: `EXERCISE_HELP`
- [X] **IMPLEMENT** automatic chat session creation for exercise help
- [ ] **ADD** exercise context to chat sessions (questionText, userAnswer, correctAnswer)
- [ ] **INTEGRATE** chapter markdown as RAG context for exercise chats
- [ ] **CREATE** chat title format: `"Exercise #1 Help: Solve 2x + 5 = 15"`
- [ ] **IMPLEMENT** numbering system for multiple help sessions: `(2)`, `(3)`, etc.
- [ ] **ENSURE** each help request creates a NEW chat session (never reuse)

**STEP 4: Implement Full-Screen Chat Integration (3 hours)**
- [ ] **REPLACE** exercise help buttons with chat navigation

- [ ] **PRESERVE** navigation state: return to test results with same accordion expanded

#### **Critical Technical Details:**

**Chat Session Creation Logic:**
```kotlin
// When user clicks "Local AI Explanation" or "Video Explanation"
fun createExerciseHelpChat(
    exerciseId: String,
    questionText: String, 
    userAnswer: Int,
    correctAnswer: Int,
    helpType: String // "Local AI" or "Video"
) {
    val sessionNumber = getExistingHelpSessionCount(exerciseId) + 1
    val title = if (sessionNumber == 1) {
        "Exercise #${exerciseNumber} Help: ${questionText.take(30)}..."
    } else {
        "Exercise #${exerciseNumber} Help: ${questionText.take(30)}... (${sessionNumber})"
    }
    
    // Pre-fill context in chat
    val initialContext = """
    Question: ${questionText}
    Your Answer: ${userAnswer}
    Correct Answer: ${correctAnswer}
    """
    
    // Auto-inject RAG context: Chapter markdown + exercise details
    createChatSession(title, EXERCISE_HELP, initialContext, ragContext)
}
```

**Navigation Preservation Logic:**
```kotlin
// When returning from exercise help chat
fun returnToTestResults(expandedQuestionId: String) {
    navigateToTestResults()
    // Preserve accordion state - keep the same question expanded
    testResultsState.expandedQuestion = expandedQuestionId
}
```

**Chat Categories Architecture:**
```
Course: Algebra Basics
  Chapter: Linear Equations
    üìö General Chapter Discussion
    ‚ùì Exercise Help
      - Exercise #1 Help: Solve 2x + 5 = 15
      - Exercise #1 Help: Solve 2x + 5 = 15 (2)
      - Exercise #3 Help: Find x in 3x - 7 = 14
    üìù Text Questions
      - "How to solve complex equations?" (from text selection)
```
