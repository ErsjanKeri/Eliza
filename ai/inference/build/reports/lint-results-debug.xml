Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

Make sure all native libraries within your application, including those from dependencies, are built with 16 KB page alignment.&#xA;&#xA;This lint check looks at all native libraries that your app depends on. If any are found to be aligned to 4 KB instead of 16 KB, you will need to address this.&#xA;&#xA;When a library is flagged, first try to update to a newer version that supports 16 KB alignment.
